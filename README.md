"About Me" guessing game project

In this project, I wrote a guessing game that tests the user about their knowledge of my life.

Correct Answers:

(1) Yes, I have gone skydiving
(2) No, I have not hiked in Cambodia.
(3) No, I have not bouldered in the Cascades.
(4) Yes, I have lived in Madrid.
(5) Yes, I have read "The Silmarillion."

I also added the additional feature of a pointCounter, which records the user's points and displays their end score.
